We are blending ecology and traditions. De Umah is carefully maintained to ensure it is kept as green and natural as possible. An healthy environment for guests and staff.

We respect and work with the natural elements protecting and preserving the environment around our homestay.

Our kitchen uses organic vegetables and herbs from our own garden. We are composting and improving the soil. We plant vegetables in the garden and even grow stuff up our stone walls.

We aim to reduce energy consumption. Energy saving light bulbs are used throughout the resort (including LED). We measure and monitor energy usage, electric, fuel and gas.

We use recycled water for watering the plants, grass and flowers limiting the use of clean water.

The resort supports the local economy and give back to the local community.
