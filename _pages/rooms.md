description: De Umah Bali is a real Balinese compound that implements the traditional architecture called Asta Kosala Kosali. Each building follows a precise location to be in tune with the spiritual meaning of the place. Built using the step of the owner as a base measure for its proportions to incorporate his spirit in the building itself.
