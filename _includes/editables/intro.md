De Umah Bali is a real Balinese compound that implements the traditional architecture called 'Asta Kosala Kosali' or 'Asta Bumi'. Each building follows a precise location to be in tune with the spiritual meaning of the place. It's built using the step of the owner as a base measure for its proportions to incorporate his spirit in the building itself.
