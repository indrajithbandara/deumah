Bale Kayu rooms are extensions of our Balinese House compound. We dispose of 5 unique rooms built out of local wood.

The design of Bale Kayu is totally traditional with just a modern touch to complement it. It will make your staying at De Umah Bali an unique experience worth remembering.

>"We really liked all that wood around us. It did bring us back to a natural life that we miss so much in the city." _Miu Wong, Taiwan_

Each Bale Kayu room have his own veranda balcony facing the green of our garden.  You will be able to absorb the very relaxing atmosphere while staying in our Bale Kayu.

These rooms are equipped with either an extra large double bed or 2 single beds. Each room has his own cozy bathroom, partly open to the sky, complete with hot shower.

Your soul will surely be soothed because every Bale Kayu room has no TV, nor other noisy equipment.
