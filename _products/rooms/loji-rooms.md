>"I really loved this luminous room with view on the garden. The peace was really enjoyable... just relaxing there, especially during the mid day hot hours." _Miriram Turnpike, USA_

Loji rooms feature either a double bed or two single beds made of local wood. The big double bed offers a mosquito net to let you sleep and dream without worries.

Wooden wardrobe, a desk table with a big mirror, bed lamp and thick curtains, in case you like to sleep in late, complete the rooms. A cute bathroom offer your refreshing showers, a stylish wash basin and a modern toilet.
