>"Staying for a couple of days at De Umah's Gedong Room made me feel like a king. My queen was so excited about this gorgeous place that it was like we were on honey moon again." _Bernard Swartz, Germany_

Roofed with natural alang-alang material, this room has a parquet floor, red brick walls, a desk with mirror and a wooden wardrobe to scent your truly romantic cocoon for two.

A private bathroom complement the setup and offers you either a cold or hot shower for your refreshment, a toilet and a single washbasin with a large mirror.

The Gedong room is a very important component of the Balinese home. It's used to host the teenagers the night before the tooth filing ceremony. Here they will be taught about the meaning of mature life. It will also give hospitality to the bride the night before the wedding. Usually, the only people allowed to stay in this room are the holy ones.
