Bale Dangin Rooms are placed in a self-contained pavilion behind our Bale Bengong and in front of Bale Dangin. The Bale Dangin is a special place in the Balinese Home where all the ceremony for the humans take place, for example wedding, tooth-filing, baby ceremonies and the such.

These cozy rooms feature Balinese traditional wood carved doors, a nice veranda with a low table to sit the Indonesian style and enjoy the quietness of the garden.

>"I found my stay here really recharging. A comfortable base to explore the Balinese village life. I especially loved the veranda where we had enjoyed the cool breeze at the end of the day, and the peace of listening to the bird singing." _Monique Cerrafoux, France_

Equipped with a double bed and fresh white canopy mosquito net under an high ceiling. A wooden wardrobe provides space to store your clothes. A simple bathroom with single washbasin, mirror, hot shower and toilet complete the rooms.

To deliver a truly quiet experience, each bedroom has no TV, DVD or other modern noisy equipments, making sure our guest's peace is preserved.
