>"I can boast that I can cook Balinese recipes now, my husband is loving it and I just recently cooked for my neighbors and impressed them..." _Machiko Fukumi, Japan_

The tour will follow with enjoying your own cooked lunch. You are also invited to learn a typical Balinese activity, making the Canang offerings.
