Once arrived at Undisan Village in Bangli, you will be welcomed by a local who will guide you to visit elementary school, walking through the inner side of the village.

Arriving at the rice field area you will start to explore and perceives life as a Balinese traditional farmer, how to plow the rice in the traditional way.

>"It was enchanting to learn about this ancient way of living, in our modern life we can hardly imagine that we can experience such thing as a traditional farmer life" _Pedro & Maria, Spain_


You will learn to work the land using a pair of cow buffalos and plant the rice sprouts which needs a balancing movement. A fresh young coconut drink and lunch in the hut in the middle of the rice fields will follow.

We will continue with a mellow trekking around rice fields, visit Dalem Temple, the temple of God Shiva, go to the Waterfall, visit a silver and gold smith homemade jewelry production used for Balinese dancers and during Balinese weddings.

At last we will visit to a Balinese house compound to join a typical Balinese activities such as making offerings and you will be taught an introduction to traditional Gamelan or Rindik music.
